    <p>The configuration process consists of the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select the events to track from those supported by Brightcove Player.</li>
      <li>Select the custom dimensions from those supported by Google Analytics.</li>
      <li>In Google Analytics, create the selected custom dimension.</li>
      <li>In Video Cloud Studio, add configuration information about the Google Analytics plugin using the player's JSON editor.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Select_events">Select events</h2>
    <p>In the JSON configuration you will list the events you wish to track. Decide which of the following you to track, and they will be used later:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>player_load</li>
      <li>video_engagement</li>
      <li>video_impression</li>
      <li>play_request</li>
      <li>ad_start</li>
      <li>ad_end</li>
      <li>error</li>
      <li>video_view</li>
      <li>video_complete</li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Select_custom_dimensions">Select custom dimensions</h2>
    <p>There are eight custom dimensions from which you can choose to use in your Google Analytics data. Decide which of the following to use, and they will be used later:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>bcvideo_account</li>
      <li>bcvideo_platform_version</li>
      <li>bcvideo_player</li>
      <li>bcvideo_range</li>
      <li>bcvideo_session</li>
      <li>bcvideo_tags</li>
      <li>bcvideo_video_duration</li>
      <li>bcvideo_video_seconds_viewed</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Create_custom_dimensions">Create custom dimensions</h2>
    <p>For each of the custom dimensions you are using, you must create. The steps in this document from Google lead you through the process: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709829?hl=en">Create and edit custom dimensions and metrics</a>.</p>
    <p>During the creation of each custom dimension, you will be asked to select a <strong>Scope</strong>. For these custom dimensions use the value <samp>Hit</samp> Also, when you create each custom dimension an index, or sequence, number will be associated with it, as shown in this screenshot:</p>

      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/general/ga-self-configure/custom-dimension-index.png" alt="custom dimension index">
    </figure>
    <p>You will need the table of created custom dimensions available as the index number is needed in the JSON.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Add_JSON_configuration_to_player">Add JSON configuration to player</h2>
    <p>You've made the decisions about what events to use, and what custom dimensions to use, and created the latter. You are know ready to build the JSON that you will include in the player configuration.</p>
