  <h1>Brightcove Player Sample: Player Styling Playground</h1>
  <summary>This topic provides you a playground for experimenting with player styling.</summary>
<section id="Styling_playground" class="bcls-section">
<h2>Styling playground</h2>

<p>In this topic you will use a Codepen, shown below, as a styling playground. View it in on the <a href="//codepen.io/team/bcls/pen/QNOMgW">codepen.io</a> site to make changes, and feel free to fork the Codepen for your own use. Note that you may want to hide the JavaScript panel in Codepen, since it's not used for anything here, and make the CSS pane larger.</p>
