<p>In the player you will see videos randomly selected from a playlist that continually play as background videos. Also, at the start of each video the title and description of each video are displayed overlaying the background video. In this example a way to stop the playlist from repeating is also shown. It is a rare use case in which you would want the playlist to repeat indefinitely.</p>

      <summary><h2 id="Using_the_CodePen">Using the CodePen</h2></summary>
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong class="notranslate">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>

      <summary><h2 id="Development_sequence">Development sequence</h2></summary> 
      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

To understand working with this API it is vital you read and understand the <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs</a> document.</aside> --></section>
<!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>

<p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>

<h3>Player configuration</h3>

<p>Be sure when you create the player the following settings are implemented:</p>

<figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Set responsive" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/samples/background-playlist/player-settings1.png" />
<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Set responsive</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Set playlist" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/samples/background-playlist/player-settings2.png" />
<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Set playlist</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Set autostart and play when selected" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/samples/background-playlist/player-settings3.png" />
<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Set autostart and play when selected</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Set skip to next video in a playlist" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/samples/background-playlist/player-settings4.png" />
<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Set skip to next video in a playlist</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Other HTML</h3>

<p>First, the in-page embed player code is nested in TWO HTML <code>div</code> elements. Both of the <code>div</code>s contain the appropriate styles to fill the entire browser window, and behave responsively. Next, another <code>div</code> element is used to define where the text that is placed over the background video should be located.</p>
</section>
<!-- UPDATE application flow -->

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>

<p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Appropriately style the player and box that contains the overlaid text.</li>
	<li>Before the playlist is placed in the player, using the <code>duringplaylistchange</code> event, randomize the playlist using the <code>player.playlist.shuffle()</code> method.</li>
	<li>Set the playlist to repeat indefinitely.</li>
	<li>On the load of every video from the playlist display the video title and short description.</li>
</ul>
<!-- UPDATE task 1 -->

<h3>Randomize the playlist</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// +++ Shuffle (randomize) the videos +++</code></pre>

<p>The <code>on()</code> method is used to listen for the <code>duringplaylistchange</code> event to be dispatched. This lets you randomize the playlist BEFORE it is placed in the player. If you don't do this you will either see the playlist reflect the shuffling (different videos' posters will quickly be shown in the player), or the poster for the first video in the un-shuffled playlist will flash in the player.</p>

<h3>Set the playlist to repeat</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// +++ Set the playlist to repeat, but stop after 2 times through +++</code></pre>

<p>The <code>repeat()</code> method from the Playlist API is used to keep the playlist playing indefinitely. If you wish to halt the repeating use the <code>playlistitem</code> event, which is dispatched every time a video from the playlist is played. In this case, since there are four videos in the playlist, and you wish to stop the playlist after 2 repetitions, you would count the number of times <code>playlistitem</code> is dispatched. When the counter is great than four (or greater than or equal to 4, both will work), stop the playlist from repeating. When you set <code>myPlayer.playlist.repeat(false);</code>, the playlist will finish the current loop through all the videos.</p>
<!-- UPDATE task 2 -->

<h3>Display the title and description</h3>

<p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Display the title and description ###</code></pre>

<p>An event handler is used to wait for the <code>loadstart</code> event. This is done as the <code>mediainfo</code> object is not populated until that event is dispatched. Then the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> are injected into the HTML.</p>
</section>
<!-- UPDATE CSS description -->

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>

<p>The CSS performs the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Makes the background color of the window black.</li>
	<li>Hides the player controls for the background video player.</li>
	<li>Disables pointer events on the player.</li>
	<li>Styles the box that overlays the text. Depending on the size of your player and the amount of content display these styles may need to be adjusted.</li>
	<li>Styles the <code>h1</code> used in the overlay text.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>

<p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code>ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>

<p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>

<p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options) {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
<!-- UPDATE path to plugin's JavaScript -->

<p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18541-background-video-random-playlist/blob/master/plugin/background-playlist-random.js">background-playlist-random.js</a>.</p>

<h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>

<p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
