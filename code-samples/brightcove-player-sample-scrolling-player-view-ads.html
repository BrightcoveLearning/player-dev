title: 'Brightcove Player Sample: Scrolling Player into View with Ads'
description: 'In this topic, you will learn how to use a Brightcove Player which starts playing the video or ad as soon as you fully scroll the player into view, and pauses the video or ad when you scroll it out of view. The Brightcove Player API <code translate="No">play()</code> and <code translate="No">pause()</code> methods are called to start and stop the video based on the position of the player.'

    <p>Scroll the player in and out of view. When the player is fully scrolled into view, the video or ad will start playing. When you scroll the player out of view, the video or ad will stop playing. In this example there is a pre-roll, a skippable mid-roll at five seconds, and a post-roll.</p>

      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong translate="No">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong translate="No">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong translate="No">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>

  <!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>The <code translate="No">muted</code> attribute has been added to the player so as to avoid autoplay issues. See the <a href="/playback/autoplay-considerations.html">Autoplay Considerations</a> document for details.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>An HTML <code translate="No">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is used to import the jQuery library and the JavaScript for the IMA3 Plugin. In the HTML's <code translate="No">head</code> section the IMA3's CSS is imported using an HTML <code translate="No">&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE application flow -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure the IMA3 Plugin.</li>
      <li>Listen for scroll events.</li>
      <li>When a scroll event is handled, check if the player is in the viewport or not.</li>
      <li>If the player in the viewport, play the video, if it is not, pause the video.</li>
      <li>Track ad events to determine if the normal Brightcove Player or ad player is in current use.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Configure IMA3 plugin</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Configure IMA3 plugin</code></pre>
    <p>The IMA3 plugin is configured to use a VMAP configuration that will play a pre-, mid- and post-roll.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Listen for any scroll events on the <strong>window</strong> element</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Execute every time page is scrolled ###</code></pre>
    <p>This one line of code calls the <code translate="No">checkIfVideoInView()</code> method on every <code translate="No">window.onscroll</code> event dispatch.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Handle the scroll events</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Called on scroll, check if in view and the play/pause ###</code></pre>
    <p>The <code translate="No">checkIfVideoInView()</code> event handler function generally checks if the player is in the viewport, then either plays or pauses the video. It is critical that the code determine which player is being used, the normal player or the ad player. The Boolean value <code translate="No">isAdPlaying</code> is toggled based on ad events (in the event handler at the bottom of the code), then a conditional (ternary) operator is used to assign the <code translate="No">currentPlayer</code> variable the correct player. The <code translate="No">isScrolledIntoView()</code> method is used in an if statement to check if the player is in the viewport. Naturally, the <code translate="No">isScrolledIntoView()</code> method returns a Boolean value.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Check if player is entirely in the viewport</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Checks if player is in view ###</code></pre>
    <p>This function, which returns a Boolean value, uses jQuery to determine if the player is entirely in the viewport.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Track which player is being used</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Set Boolean value for if ad is playing ###</code></pre>
    <p>A number of ad events are monitored and the Boolean value is set accordingly.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>The only CSS sets the player size.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code translate="No">ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>
    <p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
    <p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options) {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
    <!-- UPDATE path to plugin's JavaScript -->
    
    <p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18352-scrolling-player-view-ads/blob/master/plugin/scroll-into-view-ads.js">scroll-into-view-ads.js</a>.</p>
    <h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>
    <p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
