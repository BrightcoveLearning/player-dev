  <h1>Brightcove Player Sample: Register to Play</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn how to use a Brightcove Player where the user must fill in a form to view the video. There is also a sample that displays the form after a short preview of 3 seconds, as shown in the <a href="/code-samples/brightcove-player-sample-horizontal-volume-control.html">Register to Play After Preview</a> sample.</summary>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">This sample and associated code is provided as a guide for your production development. The code is not certified for production use nor officially supported.</aside>
    <p>This example displays an overlay and hides the player controls and play button before the user can view the video playing and prompts the user to login/register. When the user chooses to register or login through the form in the overlay, the overlay is hidden and the video plays. Test the functionality by <strong>clicking the buttons in the form</strong>.</p>
    <p>(Note that the sample doesn't actually do any field validation or authentication, so clicking either <strong>Register</strong> or <strong>Login</strong> and then the password <strong>Submit</strong> button that appears will cause the video to play.)</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">In the CSS for this player sample an <code translate="No">@import</code> is used to import the CSS for the Display Overlay Plugin. This is only done to address a behavior of the CodePen. In the CodePen the CSS in the tab is loaded before a link to CSS in the HTML tab. In this case, this caused the custom CSS to be overridden by the default plugin CSS, hence the need to use <code translate="No">@import</code> to be sure the custom CSS is loaded after the plugin's CSS. If you view the code in the GitHub repo, you will see the more standard approach of the HTML <code translate="No">link</code> tag, followed by the custom CSS in a <code translate="No">style</code> tag.</aside>

      <summary><h2 id="Using_the_CodePen">Using the CodePen</h2></summary>
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong translate="No">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong translate="No">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong translate="No">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>

      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

  <!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>Appropriate tags are used to link to the CSS and JavaScript for the Display Overlay Plugin.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE application flow -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into the code, let's look at the logic of the app:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="logic-diagram" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/samples/register-to-play/register-to-play.png" /></figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The example here does not implement the communication between the plugin and the backend services for registration and authentication. <span class="video-cloud-only">To get an idea of how to do that, you could look at some of our samples that access Brightcove APIs from a client (see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/">Overview: CMS API</a> for example).</span> If the backend services require authentication, you should route the requests through a proxy, so that you do not expose credentials on the client side.</aside>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure the overlay.</li>
      <li>Programmatically play the video to display the form.</li>
      <li>Process the form.</li>
      <li>Start the video when the form filled out.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Configure the Overlay</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Configure the Overlay ###</code></pre>
    <p>The overlay is configured to display when the video starts playing (causing the form to be displayed). The form is built in a long string as used by the overlay as <code translate="No">overlayConent</code>.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Programmatically play the video to display the form</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Play video to trigger form display ###</code></pre>
    <p>When the <code translate="No">loadedmetadata</code> event is dispatched you know it is safe to play the video, so the player's <code translate="No">play()</code> method is called.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Process the form</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Process the form ###</code></pre>
    <p>Standard HTML and JavaScript is used to process the form.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Play video when form filled out</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Plays video when form filled out ###</code></pre>
    <p>When the form is filled out, the overlay form is hidden, the controls are displayed and the video is starts playing again.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>The extensive CSS controls the display of the form and size of the player.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code translate="No">ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>
    <p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
);</code></pre>
    <p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options)    var myPlayer = this;
   ...
});</code></pre>
    <!-- UPDATE path to plugin's JavaScript -->
    
    <p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18157-register-play/blob/master/plugin/register-to-play.js">register-to-play.js</a>.</p>
    <h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>
    <p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
