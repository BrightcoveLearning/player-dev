    <div class="bcls-expander-content">
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong class="notranslate">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>
          </ol>

  <!-- Standard section, no changes needed -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Development_sequence" class="bcls-expander-head">Development sequence</h2>
    <div class="bcls-expander-content">
      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>When creating the player you must enable it to display playlists.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>An <code class="notranslate">&lt;ol&gt;</code> element must be added which defines the location of the playlist in the page.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Listen for the last video in the playlist to be played. This is done by checking if the video just ended is the last video in the array that contains the videos in the playlist.</li>
      <li>When the last video is played, get a video by an ID supplied, then load it in the player and start it playing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Start playing of playlist</h3>
    <p>At the top of the JavaScript, find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript notranslate">// +++ Check for loadedmetadata before acting on the playlist +++</code></pre>
    <p>Note that the <code class="notranslate">ready()</code> method is not used, rather the code waits for the <code class="notranslate">loadedmetadata</code> event to be dispatched. This is because the player itself can be ready to communicate with, but the video or playlist loading into the player will NOT be ready to interact with. Waiting for <code class="notranslate">loadedmetadata</code> ensures that the video or playlist can be started. This issue can be difficult to see as it is both browser and download speed dependent.</p>
    <h3>Check if last video is played, and if so, load desired video</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript notranslate">// +++ Define on event handler +++</code></pre>
    <p>When each video is finished playing the anonymous function that is the event handler will be called. To check if it is the last video, you compare the length of the array that contains the videos for the playlist to the position of the last video played. Note that <code class="notranslate">currentItem()</code> returns the zero indexed value from the array, so you must add 1 to the value. You then use the standard <code class="notranslate">catalog</code> methods to get and load the desired video.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Based on the logic of the application, and the information in the <a href="#Development_sequence">Development sequence</a> section earlier in this document, you will see that you cannot use this code as a plugin with the iframe player implementation because the script that specifies, fetches, and plays the extra video needs to communicate with the player.</aside>
  </section>
  <!-- Major UPDATE work here -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>The CSS if very standard when using Brightcove Player with a playlist. You style both the player using the <code class="notranslate">.video-js</code> selector and the playlist using the <code class="notranslate">.vjs-playlist</code> selector. The adjustments you will want to make are getting the widths of the player and playlist set so they maximize your horizontal real estate on your page.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- Standard section, only need to update the link to the plugin's JavaScript -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code class="notranslate">ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>
    <p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript notranslate">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
    <p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript notranslate">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options) {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
    <!-- UPDATE link here -->
    
    <p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18431-play-video-end-playlist/blob/master/plugin/videoAfterPlaylist.js">videoAfterPlaylist.js</a>.</p>
    <h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>
    <p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
