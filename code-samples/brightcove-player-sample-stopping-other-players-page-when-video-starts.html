  <h1>Brightcove Player Sample: Stopping Other Players on the Page when a Video Starts</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn how to pause all the other Brightcove Players on a page when video playback starts in one of the players. The functionality described in the document requires Brightcove Player version 5.0.3 or later.</summary>

    <p>Start playing one of the videos. Next, play the video in a different player and see that video playback stops in the other player that was playing.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">There may be cases where you want multiple players on a single web page, as shown in this sample, but generally it is a better user experience to have a single player on a page into which you load multiple videos.</aside>

      <summary><h2 id="Using_the_CodePen">Using the CodePen</h2></summary>
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong class="notranslate">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="developmentsequence">Development sequence</h2>
    <p>Normally for samples this section suggests an approach to development moving from one page to using a Brightcove Player plugin. In this case, the code acts on all the players in the page in concert, and cannot be assigned to one player as a plugin, hence no plugin code is shown.</p>

To understand working with this API it is vital you read and understand the <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs</a> document.</aside> --></section>
  <!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player, but there are three distinct players on the page inside HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags for layout control.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>No other HTML elements are added to the page.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE application flow -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine how many players are on the page.</li>
      <li>Loop over the players, initializing them as Brightcove Players and also setting a <code>play</code> event listener on each.</li>
      <li>Each time a <code>play</code> event is handled, loop over the players and pause all players that do not have the name of the player that dispatched the event.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Create a loop over the players and assign an event handler to each</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Determine the available player IDs ###</code></pre>
    <p>If you have multiple players on a page they are stored in an object name <code>videojs.players</code> with keys that are the names of the players. You use JavaScript <code>Object.keys()</code> method to extract the names of the players, which you want for the loop, not the actual player objects. In the loop you assign an event handler then push the player into an array.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Handle the <code>play</code> event and stop other player playing</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Handle all players' play event ###</code></pre>
    <p>Whenever a play event is handled, you extract the player name (id) from the event object, then loop over all the players and pause all players then don't have the name of player whose video just started playing.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>The CSS used for the page controls the layout of the multiple players.</p>
