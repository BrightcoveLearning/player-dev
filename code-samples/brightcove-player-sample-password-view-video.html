    <p>In this sample you need to enter a password to play the video. You can either click the <strong>Sign In</strong> button or hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key once you have entered the password. For testing, the password is <code>thepass</code>. If you enter the incorrect password a JavaScript alert box pops up with an appropriate message.</p>

      <summary><h2 id="Using_the_CodePen">Using the CodePen</h2></summary>
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong class="notranslate">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong class="notranslate">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>

      <summary><h2 id="Development_sequence">Development sequence</h2></summary> 
      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

    <h2 id="Light_security_example">Light security</h2>
    <p>This document has code for two different approaches to provide light security for viewing a video. <strong>Neither of these implementations are bullet proof ways to protect your videos from viewers you do not wish to play your videos.</strong> They do provide a small barrier that would take some knowledge and effort to find the correct password. If a completely secure method is needed to protect your videos see the <a href="/content-protection/overview-content-protection.html">Overview: Content Protection</a> and <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/general/overview-digital-rights-management-drm-video-cloud.html">Overview: Digital Rights Management (DRM) in Video Cloud</a> documents to get you started. The next two sections of this document provide details of the two approaches.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Store_the_password_in_a_video's_custom_field">Store the password in a video's custom field</h2>
    <p>In this approach a <strong>password</strong> custom field is read from the video and checked against the password entered in the form that overlays the player. For more about creating the custom field, see the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/creating-custom-metadata-fields.html">Creating Custom Metadata Fields</a> document.</p>
    <p>The main advantages of this approach are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every video can have a different password.</li>
      <li>If no password is entered in the custom field, the viewer of the video will NOT be prompted for a password.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main disadvantages are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A custom field must be added to the video configuration (a one time act).</li>
      <li>A password must be entered for every video for which you wish to restrict viewing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The code for this version of the plugin is detailed in this document and the plugin version is located <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18705-password-view-video/tree/master/plugin">here</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Pass_credentials_to_plugin">Pass credentials to plugin</h2>
    <p>Here the implementation logic is placed in a custom plugin, and the password for all videos viewed in the player to which the plugin is associated is passed as an option, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">You will need to get the JavaScript and CSS files from the GitHub repo and put them in an Internet accessible location under your control.</aside>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/samples/password/studio-configure-plugin.png" /></figure>
    <p>The main advantage of this approach is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One password works as valid credentials for all videos viewed with the player in which the plugin is loaded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main disadvantages are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To use different passwords you must use different players.</li>
      <li>A password will need to be entered for playing the video for every video viewed in the player.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The code for this version of the plugin follows very closely to the code detailed in this document (it is actually a bit simpler) and the plugin version is located <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18705-password-view-video/tree/master/plugin-pass-in-password">here</a>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: You could also write code to check against a backend database for correct password entry. Since there are enumerable possibilities for this implementation it is not detailed here, but would not vary greatly from the code shown.</aside>

  <!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>No other HTML elements are added to the page.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE application flow -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check if there is a password in the <code>password</code> custom field. If yes, pop up the Modal Dialog, if not, play the video.</li>
      <li>In the ModalDialog display a form for the user to enter a password.</li>
      <li>After a password is entered, and either the <strong>Sign In</strong> button is clicked or <strong>Enter</strong> key is pressed, check the entered password against the one stored in the video's metadata.</li>
      <li>If the correct password is entered, play the video. If not, pop up an alert box with an appropriate message.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Display ModalDialog if needed</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Display ModalDialog if password in video's custom field ###</code></pre>
    <p>After waiting for the <code>loadstart</code> event to be dispatched so the <code>mediainfo</code> object can be read, the password is received and checked if it is undefined. If yes, just play the video, otherwise display the ModalDialog that contains the password form. The <code>uncloseable</code> option is added so the user does not just press the <strong>ESC</strong> key and play the video.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Use event listeners to setup password check</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Add event listeners to check password ###</code></pre>
    <p>Two event listeners are setup, one if the user clicks the button and the other if the user presses the <strong>Enter</strong> key. Once the dynamically created form is placed in <code>newElement</code>, it is available in the DOM. So you can then use JavaScript's <code>querySelector()</code> method to get a handle to the element and assign event handlers.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Check if password correct</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Check entered password against saved password and act accordingly ###</code></pre>
    <p>After you get the <code>value</code> of the password input element you can compare to the password from the video's custom field. Then either play the video or popup and alert stating password did not match.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>There is a small amount of CSS to control the size of the player and the look of the form.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code>ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>
    <p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
  var myPlayer = this;
});</code></pre>
    <p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options) {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
    <!-- UPDATE path to plugin's JavaScript -->
    
    <p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18705-password-view-video/blob/master/plugin/password-to-view.js">password-to-view.js</a>.</p>
    <h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>
    <p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
