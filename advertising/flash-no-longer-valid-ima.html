    <p>Google has ceased supporting the IMA SDK for Flash and Flash VPAID ads in the HTML5 SDK, because of this ad networks and browsers are quickly removing support for Flash. To make sure ads continue to play and your Brightcove Players don't pause to ask viewers to install Flash, you should check to be sure your players are configured correctly.</p>
    <p>Any older players that may have Flash as the ad preference should be updated using the <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module legacy interface.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Of course, make sure your ad service is properly configured to deliver ads that do not require Flash.</aside>
