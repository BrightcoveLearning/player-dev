  <h1>Guide: contrib-ads Migration</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn about some points when migrating to the the latest version of <strong>contrib-ads</strong>.</summary>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>One of the best features of Video.js is the community of plugins and customizations that has built up around it. Ad support is an important part of that ecosystem, but not all plugin authors write with advertisements in mind. Brightcove is making some big changes in <a href="//github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads">videojs-contrib-ads</a> to make advertisements more compatible with the rest of the Video.js universe. In version 2.0 of the plugin, the plugin re-dispatches events with different prefixes depending on whether an ad is playing or not. When an ad is playing, events are prefixed with <strong>ad</strong> and when content is resuming after an ad break, events are prefixed with <strong>content</strong>. For instance, a <code translate="No">pause</code> event during an ad would become an <code translate="No">adpause</code> event. This means from the perspective of a (non-ad) plugin author, Video.js will behave just the same whether ads are playing or not. And if someone wants to write a plugin that is ad-aware, those original events are still available for them to hook into.</p>

    <h2>Migration procedures</h2>
    <p>If you've written your own ad integration on top of <a href="//github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads">videojs-contrib-ads</a>, there's a couple things you should do to prepare for the upgrade:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply the appropriate prefix to your event handlers. If you were listening for <code translate="No">timeupdate</code> events during ad playback, you should now be listening for <code translate="No">adtimeupdate</code>. Video events that occur during content playback are unaffected.</li>
      <li>Listen for <code translate="No">contentended</code> to trigger postrolls instead of <code translate="No">ended</code>. When the content is playing, the <code translate="No">ended</code> event gets captured and re-dispatched as <code translate="No">contentended</code> so that other plugins don't see multiple <code translate="No">ended</code> events for the same video. After the content and postrolls have finished, contrib-ads will fire an <code translate="No">ended</code> event.</li>
      <li>Advise your users to include and initialize your plugin before they fire up other plugins. The contrib-ads plugin will take care of re-dispatching events, but it can't hide them for plugins that are registered earlier in the listener chain.</li>
      <li>The extended support for postrolls added a new <code translate="No">postrollTimeout</code> option, similar to prerolls. If you do not wish to play a postroll for a video, you can fire <code translate="No">adtimeout</code> to proceed to the next video immediately.</li>
    </ul>
