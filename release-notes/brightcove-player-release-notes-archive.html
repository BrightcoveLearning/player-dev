            <strong style="color:#990000">Note:</strong> By default, updates are
            applied to all players automatically. To prevent auto-updating of a player
            you must set it to manual updating (also known as locking a player). You
            can do this in the
            <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">Studio Players module (external site)</a>
            or using the
            <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/guides/opting-out-automatic-player-updates.html">Player Management API</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opting out of auto-updates should be a temporary measure, applied while
            you resolve any issues that the update creates. If you do not update
            players to the current version, you are missing out on new features and
            bug-fixes, and older versions of the player will cease to be supported at
            some point

        <h2>VERSION 6 - v6.45.4</h2>

        <p>9 Oct 2020</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Updated to VHS 2.1.0</li>
            <li>Updated to Video.js 7.9.3</li>
            <li>Fixed a regression in support for <code translate="No">language</code> attribute on the video embed. This use-case is deprecated; <code translate="No">language</code> is not a valid attribute for the &lt;video&gt; or &lt;video-js&gt; element!</li>
            <li>Fixed failures with previews and file URLs with query parameters</li>
            <li>Now show DRM version in player info modal if it is findable</li>
            <li>VHS 2 - The inclusion of <em>VHS 2.1.0</em> in the Brightcove Player is a huge milestone for Brightcove. This major update to our playback engine sets us up for many future enhancements. It represents the culmination of many months of behind the scenes effort, testing, and refinement. No differences in player behavior will be noticed from viewers point of view. Congratulations to everyone who contributed to delivering VHS 2!</li>
            <li>Setting <code translate="no">policy_key</code> to <code translate="no">none</code> in the player configuration will no longer work (this is done in some edge cases). Instead, set <code translate="no">policy_key</code> to <code translate="no">nil</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>VERSION 5 - 5.28.1</h2>

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
            <p>
                Brightcove Player version 5 is no longer supported. Published players
                will continue to work and will not be disabled, but Brightcove cannot
                guarantee future compatibility with browsers, APIs, video formats,
                integrations, and other changes that may happen outside of the player.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our recommendation is to upgrade to the most recent release of version
                6. If you require any assistance doing so, please contact Brightcove
                Support.

            <li>
                Allow <code translate="No">playsinline</code> and <code translate="No">muted</code> options at the

            </li>
            <li>
                Extend the <strong>bc</strong> global with per-embed properties. In
                short, this improves support for multiple simultaneous players on a
                single page using the advanced/in-page embed; however, mixing 5.x and
                6.x players is still not advised as it can cause icons to go missing in
                some situations. More information will be coming in the form of
                documentation on this topic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed an issue where the <strong>Big Play Button</strong> was missing
                for players using the Graphite skin on iOS 11
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed an issue parsing some ID3 tags with an incorrect PES_packet_length
                header

            It should be noted that, in this context, making the player "responsive to
            browser size by default" is distinct from making the player fluid. The
            following should clarify the new feature:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>To be clear: static players will not suddenly become fluid!</li>
            <li>
                The use of "responsive" in this context means we have enabled the new
                Video.js responsive option in the Brightcove Player by default (whereas
                it is off by default in Video.js). This option will cause a
                <code translate="No">vjs-layout-*</code> class to be applied to the player based on a
                default set of breakpoints whenever the size of the player is changed.
                This means that the "responsiveness" is not actually based on the
                browser viewport size, but on the size of the embedded player.
            </li>
            <li>
                Two small UI adjustments have been made based on this new Video.js
                option. It is anticipated these adjustments should not affect many
                users, if any, but in the interests of completeness, they are in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Captions settings dialog</li>
                    <li>Social plugin dialog</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Users who have responsive embeds from the Studio or via Video.js' fluid
                option will be able to take advantage of the new
                <code translate="No">vjs-layout-*</code> classes to improve their player UI
                customizations based on the player size. And users who have
                statically-sized embeds will still get a <code translate="No">vjs-layout-*</code> class
                applied to their player, but it won't change unless the size of the
                player changes at runtime.
            </li>
            <li>
                For small width player implementations (like 425px), it is possible that
                some buttons in the controlbar will be hidden. Although you will loose
                the responsive features, the following code will prevent the buttons
                from being hidden:
                <pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-javascript" translate="No">&lt;script&gt;
    videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
      var myPlayer = this;
      myPlayer.responsive(false);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
            </li>

            does not appear:

            </li>

        <h3>VERSION 6 - 6.18.3</h3>

        <p>2 May 2018</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Addressed an issue where calling <code translate="No">bc()</code> as a getter in a
                plugin could confuse the initialization process; note that using
                <code translate="No">bc()</code> or <code translate="No">videojs()</code> as a getter is not
                recommended - use <code translate="No">videojs.getPlayer()</code> instead!
            </li>
            <li>No longer overrides casing in names in chapters menu</li>
            <li>
                Fixed an issue where focus on the play button would keep the control bar
                visible on mobile
            </li>
            <li>
                Silenced a non-breaking error message when a pause interrupts a play
                request in HLS playback
            </li>
            <li>Adjusted last menu position when fullscreen control is disabled</li>
            <li>Fixed ad failover support in iframe embeds.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Added support for populating the player's playlist via catalog searches
                and/or a sequence of queries
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow configuration describing how query string parameters should be

        <ul>
            <li>
                Reverted: Due to Chrome 66 autoplay policy changes, no longer hide the
                Big Play Button while waiting for autoplay. Brightcove plans to replace
                this behavior in the coming weeks in a way that works more completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now use HTTPS URLs where we were previously using protocol-relative
                URLs. This may address some issues that have been seen on uncommon and
                officially unsupported platforms where protocol-relative URLs were
                interpreted using the <strong>file:</strong> protocol.

                short, this improves support for multiple simultaneous players on a
                single page using the advanced/in-page embed; however, mixing 5.x and
                6.x players is still not advised as it can cause icons to go missing in
                some situations. More information will be coming in the form of
                documentation on this topic.

                        No longer timeout segment requests if there is only one playlist

        <h3>New features</h3>

        <p>
            Brightcove Player version 5 has new support for HLS video without using
            Flash. In this release, in all browsers that support the Media Source
            Extensions API (MSE), the Brightcove Player can play HLS videos
            <strong>without Flash!</strong> That means Flash is not used on Firefox,
            Chrome, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Flash will still be used for older
            versions of IE but can be disabled by config.
        </p>

        <p>MSE HLS provides several huge benefits:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Videos will load fast and play smoothly, even at high resolutions and
                high frame rates,
                <strong> including 4K and 60FPS video - on modest hardware </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                It uses approximately <strong>-50% of the CPU load</strong> to render
                the same videos, meaning batteries will last longer and your laptop fan
                won￯﾿ﾢ￯ﾾﾀ￯ﾾﾙt turn on
            </li>
            <li>
                Power saving and other browser settings to limit the use of Flash will
                <strong>no longer have any effect on the player</strong> regardless of
                the player￯﾿ﾢ￯ﾾﾀ￯ﾾﾙs dimensions
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Other features in this release include:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>New skin</strong> - Based on significant UX research we have
                built a new skin that incorporates many changes. These include a new,
                centered big play button, new colors, new seek bar behavior, and a new
                title bar called the dock. Usability testing participants especially
                loved the new timeline that expands on hover and makes it easier to seek
                to a specific time. You can now choose between the default new skin,
                called Luna, and the old 1.x skin, now called Graphite.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Initial support for live captions</strong> - this release now
                supports many 608/708 caption encoding systems. This includes support
                for the popular pop-on and roll-up methods and basic styling
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Compatibility mode</strong> for all 1.x and Video.js 4.x
                plugins. (except DASH/DRM, FreeWheel, and OnceUX plugins - updates to
                follow during Q1)
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Also in this version, we have made many updates to improve the programming
            model for customization, including simplifications to our skinning model
            and the API for plugins. These changes bring us up-to-date with our latest
            open source release, Video.js 5. You will also notice that we have also
            synchronized our version numbering between Video.js and Brightcove Player
            releases.
