            <strong style="color:#990000">Note:</strong> By default, updates are
            applied to all players automatically. To prevent auto-updating of a player
            you must set it to manual updating (also known as locking a player). You
            can do this in the
            <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">Studio Players module (external site)</a>
            or using the
            <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/guides/opting-out-automatic-player-updates.html">Player Management API</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opting out of auto-updates should be a temporary measure, applied while
            you resolve any issues that the update creates. If you do not update
            players to the current version, you are missing out on new features and
            bug-fixes, and older versions of the player will cease to be supported at
            some point
