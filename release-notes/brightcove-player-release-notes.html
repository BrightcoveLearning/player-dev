      <strong style="color:#990000">Note:</strong> By default, updates are applied to all players automatically. To prevent auto-updating of a player you must set it to manual updating (also known as locking a player). You can do this in the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">Studio Players module (external site)</a> or using the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/guides/opting-out-automatic-player-updates.html">Player Management API</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opting out of auto-updates should be a temporary measure, applied while you resolve any issues that the update creates. If you do not update players to the current version, you are missing out on new features and bug-fixes, and older versions of the player will cease to be supported at
      some point.</p>
