    <p>
      Google Chromecast is a device that you plug into your TV's HDMI port.
      Using your smartphone or computer as a remote control, you can use
      Chromecast to access video content. The Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove
      Player enables the player to cast video from your desktop or
      Android Chrome browser to the Chromecast device.
    </p>
    <p>The plugin supports all
      Video Cloud videos or external streams using HLS or DASH, including
      DRM-encrypted streams using Widevine. Advertising is supported through
      Video Cloud server-side ad insertion (SSAI). Client-side ads and playlists
      are not supported.</p>
    <p>To use the plugin follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>
        Load the Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player (detailed below).
      </li>
      <li>
        Be sure the Chromecast device is on the same network as your device that
        will play the video.
      </li>
      <li>Start playing the video.</li>
      <li>Click the cast button and select your Chromecast device.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The software behind Chromecast is comprised of the following components:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Sender application</strong>: This is any application that can initiate a cast session and communicate with a receiver. The sender
          application can be thought of as the "client side" portion of the
          Chromecast ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player enables the sender app in
          Brightcove Player. You will learn about it in this topic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Receiver application</strong>: This is a custom web application that is hosted on the public internet and runs on a Chromecast device. It handles
          communication between the sender app and the receiver device. It can be thought of as a single page HTML
          app with CSS and JavaScript assets.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          As a Brightcove Player customer, you do not need to work with the code
          and configuration of the receiver application. By default, this plugin
          uses the Brightcove receiver app.
        </p> -->
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
          For Chromecast to work with domain restricted players, you should
          whitelist the Chromecast receiver's domain, which is
          <code translate="No">players.brightcove.net</code>.

    <h2 id="Requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The following requrements are needed for the Chromecast plugin:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="How_it_Works">How it Works</h2>
    <p>The current implementation (plugin/receiver version 2.x) uses the CAF (Cast Application Framework) API.</p>
    <p>
      When the Chromecast receiver plugin is added, the player will display a cast button in the player UI when there is an available Chromecast on the local network.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this button is clicked or tapped, a cast session is initiated with the current video that is loaded in the Brightcove Player. Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>The plugin sends a set of parameters to the receiver.</li>
      <li>The receiver mirrors the sending player by loading it from Brightcove's CDN.</li>
      <li>Once loaded, the receiver-side player loads the video ID from the Playback API that was sent when the cast session began.</li>
      <li>Then, the receiver-side player begins playback at the playhead position of the sending player.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This process is identical for non-Video Cloud sources except there is no Playback API request.</p>
    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>Currently, from an analytics perspective, the cast session is treated as an entirely new playback session.</p>
    <p>From a UX perspective, the viewer will see their stream pause on the sender device and resume on the receiver.</p>
    <p>From a data perspective, because our metrics are anonymized by default, it is logged as a new viewer starting a new stream on a separate device. This is what actually happens.</p>

    <h2 id="Using_the_plugin">Using the plugin</h2>
    <p>
      The Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player is used like all other
      Brightcove Player plugins, that is you must load the plugin into the
      player.
    </p>
    <h3>Using Studio</h3>
    <p>The following steps detail using Studio to load the plugin.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
          When configured in Studio, the Player Management API will automatically select the best version combination for your player. If you get <strong>v1.x</strong> of the Chromecast plugin, you need to update your player!
        </aside>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>
        Open the <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module and either create a new player
        or locate the player to which you wish to add the plugin.
      </li>
      <li>Select the link for the player to open the player's properties.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Plugins</strong> in the left navigation menu.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Next, select the <strong>Add a Plugin</strong> button, and then select
          <strong>Brightcove Plugin</strong>.

        <p>
          Once the plugin is loaded, the video has started playing, and an
          available Chromecast device is in range, the cast button will appear
          in the player as shown here in this screenshot of a player:

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">

            The Chromecast plugin's cast button will appear in the player's
            controlbar when an available Chromecast device is in range.

    <h2 id="Configuration_options">Configuration options</h2>
    <p>
      No matter which method you choose to setup the Chromecast Plugin for
      Brightcove Player, you can pass options to modify plugin
      behavior.&nbsp;While setting these options is not necessary, additional
      customization is possible for advanced users. The available options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code translate="No">playerUrl </code><br />
        <strong>Default</strong>:
        <code translate="No">URL of current player</code>
        <p>
          When unspecified, this will point to the player that is casting your
          videos. Supplying this option will force the receiver to load a
          specific player rather than the player that is currently casting the
          video. This is useful when you want specific player code to only run
          on the Chromecast.
        </p>
        <p>Since this is a Brightcove player that is loaded on the receiver, you can customize, style and debug the player outside of Chromecast.</p>
      </li>
      <!-- <li>
        <code translate="No">js </code><br />
        <strong>Default</strong>: <code translate="No">[] </code>
        <p>
          An array of custom JavaScript to load after the player JavaScript has
          loaded on the Chromecast receiver.
        </p>
      </li> -->
      <li>
        <code translate="No">css </code><br />
        <strong>Default</strong>: <code translate="No">[] </code>
        <p>
          An array of custom CSS to load after the player CSS is loaded on the
          Chromecast receiver.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To pass options in code, you would use something similar to the following:
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
  var myPlayer = this;
  options = {};
  options.playerUrl = '//players.brightcove.net/1752604059001/default_default/index.min.js';
  myPlayer.chromecastReceiver(options);
});</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Known_issues">Known issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Chromecast Plugin is supported with the Brightcove Player version
        6+.
      </li>
      <li>
        Google has stopped supporting non-secure origins (HTTP) with Chromecast,
        hence the plugin will not work in non-secure contexts. In these cases,
        the player's Chromecast button will not appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since the Chromecast Plugin relies on the browser's support for casting,
        it is only supported in the following OS/browser combinations:
        <ul>
          <li>Desktop/Chrome</li>
          <li>Android/Chrome</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Google does not support multiple instances of the Chromecast sender
        button on a single page. Possible workarounds would be to embed the
        Brightcove Player using the Standard (iframe) player implementation, or
        to dynamically instantiate and destroy players as needed. See the
        document
        <a
          href="/code-samples/brightcove-player-sample-loading-player-dynamically.html"
          >Brightcove Player Sample: Loading the Player Dynamically</a
        >
        for information on the latter possibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        This plugin does not cast to Google Nest Hub. The plugin only supports
        actual Chromecast devices (i.e. Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra).
      </li>
    </ul>
