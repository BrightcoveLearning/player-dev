        <h2 id="section-name">AMP and Advertising When Using a Video Cloud Video</h2>
        <p>Advertising, including prerolls, works in players used in AMP.</p>
        <p>The ad plugin and its configuration just need to be included in the player's configuration. If you need to include article-specific values in your ad server calls, you can pass custom data through to a player plugin as described below.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, AMP is very strict in what can be added to a valid AMP page. For example, you CANNOT add an <code translate="No">id</code> to the <code translate="No">amp-brightcove</code> tag then use a <code translate="No">script</code> block to configure, for instance, the IMA3 plugin. To reiterate what was said in the previous paragraph, advertising must be implemented in the player's configuration, either using Studio or the Player Management API.</p>
        <p>If you wish to use ad configuration URLs that utilize an ad macro such as <code translate="No">{pageVariable.adId}</code>, you must alter the player's configuration. You can use a custom parameter (as described just above) like:</p>
        <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html" translate="No">data-param-ad-id="preonlybumper"</code></pre>
        <p>This does not make the value automatically available to the ad macro <code translate="No">{pageVariable.adId}</code>. To make the <code translate="No">ad-id/adId</code> property available to the ad URL, you must use Brightcove Player's <a href="/general/player-configuration-guide.html#query_string_to_window">query_string_to_window</a> configuration option. This option controls the population of the global namespace (window) variables from query string parameters. So to make the <code class="language-html" translate="No">data-param-ad-id="..."</code> available to the plugin you must add the following to the player configuration using the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/">Player Management API</a> (also see note below the code):</p>
        <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash" translate="No">  "query_string_to_window": {
    "globals": [
      "adId"
    ]
  }</code></pre>
        <p>For specific instructions on updating a player see <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/references/reference.html#operation/UpdatePlayerConfiguration">Player_Configurations - Update a Player Configuration</a> from the Player Management API reference.</p>

        <p>Advertising, including prerolls, works in players used in AMP.</p>
        <p>The ad plugin and its configuration just need to be included in the player's configuration. If you need to include article-specific values in your ad server calls, you can pass custom data through to a player plugin as described below.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, AMP is very strict in what can be added to a valid AMP page. For example, you CANNOT add an <code translate="No">id</code> to the <code translate="No">amp-brightcove</code> tag then use a <code translate="No">script</code> block to configure, for instance, the IMA3 plugin.

    <section class="bcls-section">
        <h2 id="section-name">AMP-consent and Advertising</h2>
        <p>In AMP you can use client-side consent, providing users with additional control over their online experience. If your AMP page is managing user consent with AMP-consent, and you are using advertising in the player, then you may want to adapt the player's ad request depending on that consent.</p>
        <p>By adding a
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">data-block-on-consent="_till_responded"</code></pre>
            attribute to the amp-brightcove element, the player load will be delayed until the user has accepted or rejected consent. On subsequent pages where the consent is known, the player will load normally without a delay.</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">For more information on AMP and consent see AMP's <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/examples/user-consent/client_side_user_consent_flow/">Client Side User Consent Flow</a> document.</aside>
        <h3>Ad configurations</h3>
        <p>The simplest scenario is to use Brightcove Player's standard IMA advertising integration with Google Ad Manager, which expects <code>npa=1</code> to be added to the ad request if consent is unknown or not given. Add
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">"imaAddNpa": true</code></pre>
            to the options of the player's AMP Support Plugin, and this will be automatically added to the ad server URL, as shown here:</p>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/amp/plugin-config.png" alt="plugin configuration">
        </figure>
        <p>For other changes to the ad server URL, the consent state will be set on the player's iframe with three query parameters</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>ampInitialConsentState</code>: Whether consent is accepted, rejected, unknown</li>
            <li><code>ampConsentSharedData</code>: A JSON string of data from the consent vendor</li>
            <li><code>ampInitialConsentValue</code>: The consent string from the consent vendor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The consent state is an integer as defined in AMP:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>SUFFICIENT: 1</li>
            <li>INSUFFICIENT: 2</li>
            <li>UNKNOWN_NOT_REQUIRED: 3</li>
            <li>UNKNOWN: 4</li>
        </ul>

        First, update the player configuration to make the player iframe's query parameters to be available as simple Javascript variables, by adding to the player configuration in the JSON editor the following:
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">"query_string_to_window": {"target": "queryStringParams"}</code></pre>
        For assistance, here is a screenshot of the UI:
        </p>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
            <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/amp/json-editor.png" alt="JSON editor">
        </figure>
        <p>Then you can use the consent query parameters in the ad server request, either using macros or by configuring the severURL to be a function.</p>
        <h4>Macro example</h4>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">"adserverURL": "https://ads.example.com/ad?consent={pageVariable.queryStringParams.ampInitialConsentState}&consentString={pageVariable.queryStringParams.ampInitialConsentValue}"</code></pre>
        <h4>Function example</h4>
        Configure the player without an ad server URL, and set
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">videojs.registerPlugin('setAdUrl', function() {
  this.ima3.settings.serverUrl = function(callback) {
    if (window.queryStringParams.ampInitialConsentState === 1) {
      // Sufficient consent
      callback('https://ads.example.com/adwithconsent?string={pageVariable.queryStringParams.ampInitialConsentValue}');
    } else {
      // Use a different ad
      callback('https://ads.example.com/basicad');
    }
});</code></pre>
