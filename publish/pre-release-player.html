    <p>You may wish to frequently test against the latest version of Brightcove Player, including the pre-releases. This document shows you how to configure a player that will be updated every time a new pre-release is available. By setting the <code translate="No">"version_alias": "prerelease"</code> configuration option you can be sure this player will always have the latest prerelease version.</p>
    <p>In the Studio's <strong class="notranslate">PLAYERS</strong> module you can set a player to use always be on the latest pre-release:</p>

    <p>Studio will show if a player has been configured as a pre-release player:</p>

    <p>Whenever a new prerelease version is released for the current major version, the Player Management API republishes all players that have the prerelease version alias on their master branch.</p>

    <p>The following curl statement creates a player using the Player Management API to always use the latest pre-release :</p>

    <p>Following is a player that has been configured to use <code translate="No">"version_alias": "prerelease"</code>. In this case, the latest pre-release was version <strong class="notranslate">6.23.0</strong>.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-bash notranslate">{
    "account_id": "1507807800001",
    "compatibility": true,
    "embed_id": "default",
    "player": {
      "template": {
        "name": "single-video-template",
        <span class="bcls-highlight">"version": "6.23.0",
        "version_alias": "prerelease"</span>
      }
    },
    "player_id": "ipKAiobF4S",
    "player_name": "test for \"version_alias\": \"prerelease\"",

    "video_cloud": {
      "policy_key": "BCpkADaw...lB71l9h"
    }
  }</code></pre>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: Player configuration <code translate="No">GET</code> requests for players with the version alias will not contain the associated player version. However, when a preview or publish request is received for a player with the prerelease <code translate="No">version_alias</code>, the correct prerelease version is pulled from the Player Management API database and added to the player configuration before publishing occurs. This means that the player version can be found in the published player's <strong class="notranslate">config.json</strong> file (as shown just above). Following is an example <code translate="No">GET</code> request:
      <pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-json notranslate">{
    "video_cloud": {
      "policy_key": "BCpkADawq...1l9h"
    },
    "player": {
      "template": {
        "version_alias": "prerelease",
        "name": "single-video-template"
      }
    },
    "compatibility": true
  }</code></pre>
