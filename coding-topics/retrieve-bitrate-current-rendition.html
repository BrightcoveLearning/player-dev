    <h2 id="section-name">Retrieving the bitrate</h2>
    <p>You can use the following code to retrieve the bitrate of the currently playing rendition:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">player.tech(true).vhs.playlists.media().attributes.BANDWIDTH</code></pre>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">Even though the code contains the word <strong>playlist</strong>, this does not refer to a playlist of videos. See the <a href="#What_playlist_is_used">What playlist is used?</a> section later in this document for clarification.</aside>
    <p>The following shows how to use the code with an Advanced player implementation:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-html" translate="No">&lt;video-js id=&quot;myPlayerID&quot;
  data-account=&quot;1507807800001&quot;
  data-player=&quot;default&quot;
  data-embed=&quot;default&quot;
  controls=&quot;&quot;
  data-video-id=&quot;6201753345001&quot;
  data-playlist-id=&quot;&quot;
  data-application-id=&quot;&quot;
  width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot;&gt;&lt;/video-js&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/default_default/index.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function () {
    var myPlayer = this;
    myPlayer.on('play', function () {
      console.log('Bitrate of playing rendition :', myPlayer.tech(true).vhs.playlists.media().attributes.BANDWIDTH);
    })
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The result, in this instance, would appear in the console as follows:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/coding-topics/retrieve-bitrate-current-rendition/result-in-console.png" alt="result in console">
    </figure>

    <h3>Using the console</h3>
    <p>You can retrieve the same information in the console. Given the player is assigned an ID, in this case <code>myPlayerID</code>, the following can be used to get the bitrate of the currently playing rendition:</p>

    <h2 id="Usage_details">Usage details</h2>
    <p>Please note the following details when using the code:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The code will return the bitrate based on what is defined in the HLS or DASH manifests for a demuxed video playlist or a muxed video/audio playlist.</li>
      <li>The code will NOT work with the following:
        <ul>
          <li>MP4 encoded videos</li>
          <li>When native playback is used, like HLS on Safari</li>
          <li>When only a playlist is sent without a manifest (example: https://d2zihajmogu5jn.cloudfront.net/bipbop-advanced/bipbop_16x9_variant.m3u8)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The returned value could be a bit ahead of where playback is currently happening as Brightcove Player is always buffering content ahead of current playback location.</li>
      <li>If you wish to see information on the currently playing video's rendition playlist, you can use one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming#segment-metadata">Segment Metadata text track</a> to get information about the currently playing demuxed video playlist or muxed video/audio playlist.</li>
          <li>The <a href="/references/video-metadata-mediainfo.html">mediainfo property</a> where you can view the <code>sources</code> array, an example of which is shown here:
            <figure class="bcls-figure">
              <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/coding-topics/retrieve-bitrate-current-rendition/mediainfo-sources.png" alt="mediainfo sources">
            </figure>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It's not possible to get the bitrate information of the audio content, whether it's muxed or demuxed.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="What_playlist_is_used">What playlist is used?</h2>
    <p>In the code a playlist is referenced, but the player implementation was only playing a single video:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">myPlayer.tech(true).vhs.<span class="bcls-highlight">playlists</span>.media().attributes.BANDWIDTH</code></pre>
    <p>This is NOT referring to a playlist of videos. Rather it is referencing an HLS manifest of renditions, which is also referred to as a playlist. For instance, in this video there are both HLS and MP4 renditions (the HLS renditions, or HLS playlist, are highlighted):</p>
