title: 'Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs'
description: 'In this topic, you will first get a high level overview of using the REST APIs. Then later in the document a deeper dive will discuss example code. The first example uses the Analytics API to retrieve and display in the Brightcove player controlbar the number of views the video currently in the player has had. The second, and slightly more complex, example uses the Analytics API in conjunction with the Brightcove Player catalog to retrieve the most popular videos from an account and show them in a playlist. The code discussion in this document will center on retrieving the desired data from the correct REST API.'
