    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>Delivering video to China from outside the country is challenging due to regulations and controls, restricting the free-flow of data across its national borders. Historically, we have provided a solution that allowed Brightcove services to distribute video content through a content delivery network within the country. However, essential communications, including Playback API requests and responses, and Analytics beacons were unreliable, and at times non-functional.</p>

    <p>Brightcoveâ€™s China Delivery solution addresses the problems listed above and comprises two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A proxy server hosted within China</li>
      <li>A connected China-specific CDN</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The proxy routes non-video traffic (Playback API requests, Analytics beacons, and the web player itself) to and from viewers in China to Brightcove infrastructure located outside.</p>

    <p>The CDN is connected to the proxy and handles the video and image content.</p>

    <h2 id="Configuring_Brightcove_Player">Configuring Brightcove Player</h2>
    <p>Delivery Rules can be configured in the Brightcove Player in the following ways:</p>

    <h3>Player management API</h3>
    <p>When configuring players with the Player Management API, you can set the <code translate="No">delivery_config_id</code> configuration property as follows:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json" translate="No">{
  &quot;delivery_config_id&quot;: &quot;abcdef&quot;,
  ...
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Standard embed code</h3>
    <p>With the standard embed code (iframe), use the <code translate="No">deliveryConfigId</code> query parameter:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-html" translate="No">&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://players.brightcove.net/.../index.html?deliveryConfigId=abcdef&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
    <br>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This will override any Delivery Rules set in the player configuration.</aside>

    <h3>Advanced embed code</h3>
    <p>With the advanced embed code (in-page embed), use the <code translate="No">data-delivery-config-id</code> attribute:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-html" translate="No">&lt;video-js data-delivery-config-id=&quot;abcdef&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
    <br>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This will override any Delivery Rules set in the player configuration.</aside>

    <h3>Using the Catalog API</h3>
    <p>Using Javascript, you can fetch the delivery rule by its <code translate="No">deliveryConfigId</code> using the Catalog API:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">var player = videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerId');
player.ready(function () {
  var catalogParams = {
    deliveryConfigId: <span class="bcls-input">delivery_rules_id</span>,
    type: 'video',
    id: <span class="bcls-input">video_id</span>,
  };

  player.catalog.get(catalogParams, function (error, video) {
    if (error) {
      throw new Error(error);
    }

    player.catalog.load(video);
  });
});</code></pre>
